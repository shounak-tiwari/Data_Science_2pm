Machine learning 
1. Supervised Learning 
	1. Linear regression 
		a. simple linear regression 
			y = mx+b
		b. multiple linear regression
			y = mxix+mxi2.....mxin +b

	Many Times Data ---- Overfitting

Overfitting : expected output is not unstisfied...
Overfitting is when a machine learning models learns 
the training data too well, including noise and random
fluctuations, but it perform poorly on new or unseen data 

Underfitting : Model are not learning preporly and not train
too well and their prediction also false


When normal linear regression fails or it overfitting  we use (l2 Regularization)  
Ridge regression it is technique which is use for prevent overfitting
linear regressions model....
