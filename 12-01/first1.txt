NumPy : (Numerical Python) 
means when we want to perform any numerical computing or 
operation numpy is flexible....
Working with arrays and matrices 
Linear algebra, Statistics and numeric operations

Why Numpy is better than python list : 
1. Speed : Numpy (Array)  
2. Memory usage :  Python list (X)
3. Vectorized Ops : Numpy Arrays 
4. Machine learning  : numpy arrays
